# duoAudioPlayer
To play audio from existing file and the device's audio inputs channels.
The goal is to be able to mix the input from my vinyl record with saved mp3/wav files.
Currently, the code allows you to open a file and also reads the input channels.
I also have to add the sliders for attenuation, gain and modify the GUI so it looks more user-friendly.
To implement the code, I've used the juce documentation as a reference: https://juce.com.

To run the code, open the jucer file in Producer, save and open in ID, and build the project.
The application window should appear when running the code.
